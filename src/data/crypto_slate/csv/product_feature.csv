Using KeepKey gives you confidence that hackers can’t get to your bitcoins.Multi-Currency Support: KeepKey not only supports Bitcoin -  but also Bitcoin Cash -  Ethereum -  Litecoin -  Dogecoin -  Dash -  and ERC-20 tokens.Works on PC -  Mac -  Linux -  and Android: KeepKey is a USB HID-class device. That means -  like a typical mouse or keyboard -  drivers are not required. Plug in the provided premium USB cable -  and your device just works: immediately giving you the highest level of bitcoin security.Integrated with Shapeshift for seamless exchanges among supported assets.Materials: Anodized Aluminum Case -  Polycarbonate FrontTechnical: USB HID -  Micro-USB connector -  ARM® Cortex™-M3 -  TRNG (Hardware-Based Random Number Generator) -  256×64 3.12″ OLEDDimensions: Height: 38.0 mm -  Width: 93.5 mm -  Depth: 12.2 mmWhat’s in the Box: KeepKey -  Woven Nylon USB Cable -  Recovery Sentence Backup Card"
