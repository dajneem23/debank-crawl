Ulbricht was convicted of money laundering, computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic fraudulent identity documents, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics by means of the Internet in February 2015.  He is currently serving a double life sentence plus forty years without the possibility of parole. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the conviction and sentence in May 2017. The Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear a further appeal in June 2018.  The Maryland prosecution dismissed with prejudice a five-year-old pending indictment in July 2018.",
