    "about": "Akon BioAs soon as you hear Akon’s voice, you know it’s him!His shimmering, soulful voice has propelled countless hits across genres—from pop and R&B to hip hop and dance. In addition to his own chart-­‐dominating singles “Smack That” and “I Wanna Love You”, he’s made a staggering 300 guest appearances for icons including Michael Jackson, Lady Gaga, Gwen Stefani, Lil Wayne, R. Kelly, and Eminem. With over 35 million albums sold worldwide, five Grammy Award nominations, and 45 Billboard Hot 100 songs under his belt, he’s simply unstoppable.“Locked Up” from the singer and producer’s 2004 debut album, Trouble, made him a household name, and then Konvicted led to global superstardom. In the aftermath of the latter’s 2007 release, Akon garnered the American Music Award for Favorite R&B Male Artist, Teen Choice Award for Breakout Male Artist, three World Music Awards in the categories of Best Selling R&B Male Artist, Best Selling African Artist and Best Selling Internet Artist, and the Billboard Music Award for Artist of the Year. He was listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the #1 selling artists for master ringtones in the world and became the first solo artist in history to lock down both the number one and number two spots on the Billboard Hot 100.Never content to rest on his laurels, he was the visionary behind not one but two thriving record labels KonLive and Konvict. The imprints jump-­‐started the careers of both Lady Gaga and T-­‐Pain, with Akon recognizing their talent early on, producing, and collaborating with them.Expanding further into other realms, Akon was recognized on Forbes Magazine’s Celebrity 100 list in 2010, and Pepsi chose him to produce and record “Oh Africa” for the 2010 World Cup. For the first time in history, the event took place in Africa, the continent on which the artist was born. With a heart even bigger than his resume, Akon also created The Konfidence Foundation, a youth-­‐centric charity that benefits underserved children in Africa and the U.S. Everything he does remains emblematic of his passion.Musically, Akon has continued to push the envelope. His duet with Michael Jackson, “Hold My Hand” was released as the first single on the Michael album, debuting internationally at #1. Plus, his hilarious collaboration with Saturday Night Live stalwarts The Lonely Island, “I Just Had Sex”, set the internet ablaze, racking up over 210 million YouTube/VEVO views and being performed at the 2011 Comedy Awards and Primetime EMMY Awards.Akon still isn’t showing signs of slowing down. With a new album on deck for 2015, he has set his sights on breaking into Hollywood and is already well on his way to making his mark. In 2012, Akon made his acting debut in Jeta Amata’s stirring motion picture “Black November” alongside a stellar cast including Mickey Rourke, Kim Basinger, Anne Heche, and Vivica A. Fox. Most recently, he landed his first major movie role and will appear with costars Adrien Brody, Hayden Christensen and Jordana Brewster in the upcoming indie action thriller “American Heist”, a remake of the 1959 Steve McQueen movie “The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery.”In February 2014, Akon launched a partnership to bring electricity to one million households in Africa by the end of 2014. Akon has chosen to address the immediate needs of Africans through an effort known as “Akon Lighting Africa.” This initiative will address the concern that more than two-thirds of the population of sub-Saharan Africa is without electricity, and that more than 85 percent of those living in rural areas lack access. Akon Corp., in conjunction with GIVE1 PROJECT and Solektra International, member of ADS Group (Africa Development Solutions Group), has assembled a dynamic group of strategic partners in order to create replicable, scalable and cost-effective energy solutions.",

    "about": "Brendan Blumer BioBrendan Blumer is an American entrepreneur, executive, and investor. He is the CEO of Block.one, the tech company producing the EOS.IO distributed ledger software. He is based in Hong Kong.Blumer was born and raised in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. When he was 15 years old, he developed a website to sell virtual assets in the multiplayer online gaming space. His website, known as Gamecliff (stylized as GaMeCliff), displayed different characters, weapons, and houses for MMORPG games including EverQuest and World of Warcraft.In 2005, Blumer’s Gamecliff was acquired by IGE. The company moved to its new headquarters to Hong Kong to head Gamecliff’s operations.In 2007, Blumer founded The Accounts Network, a company that sold in-game MMORPG avatars.In 2010, Blumer launched Okay.com, an enterprise data sharing platform for real estate brokers in Asia. The company later merged with the real estate company Asia Pacific Properties.He founded ii5 in 2013, a startup dedicated to real-estate listings in India.In 2016, Brendan Blumer met software programmer Dan Larimer. In March 2017, Blumer and Larimer together formed Block.one, an open source software publishing company specializing in high-performance blockchain technologies.In May 2017, Blumer and Larimer announced their first project, EOS. Critics have argued that Block.one’s year-long EOS initial coin offering (ICO) is unnecessarily aggressive in the number of funds that it is seeking to raise for such a product.In February 2018, he was recognized by Forbes as one of “The Richest People In Cryptocurrency.”  Source: Wikipedia",

    "about": "Alexander Hughes BioI am currently studying MSc Marketing at Manchester Metropolitan University Business School, as well as working full-time at Launchpool as a marketing specialist for Web3.As a creative individual, marketing is fascinating to me, as not only does it allow us to inspire, but also express the DNA of a brand through traditional and digital platforms. We engage, interact, and subconsciously consume marketing every day. Understanding the reasoning and strategies behind how products are marketed based on primary and secondary market research is an avenue I have explored in my degree and aspire to investigate further.I am now pursuing a career in consumer marketing in web3 because the idea of better understanding ordinary people’s lives in a digital or Analog environment is becoming extremely topical. It is now challenging to avoid media, pop culture, art and therefore marketing. However, marking sure the marketing is effective, reaching your target audiences, and receiving the proper engagement is critical. Any web3 marketing strategy aims to turn a consumer into a customer, creating a community around your project. Allowing for research and a better understanding your audiences.",

Wright’s claims are widely regarded as a possible hoax.Alleged Bitcoin involvementIn December 2015, Gizmodo reported that Dave Kleiman may have been involved in the invention of the digital currency Bitcoin, based on documents sent to the press concerning Craig Steven Wright’s claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of bitcoin. Wright repeated the claim to The Economist in May 2016. Wright’s claims about the creation of Bitcoin are widely considered extremely dubious, and possibly a hoax.In February 2018, Dave Kleiman’s brother Ira, the executor of his estate, initiated a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on behalf of the Kleiman estate against Wright over the rights to between 550,000 and 1,100,000 bitcoins, claiming Wright defrauded the estate of bitcoins and intellectual property rights.The estate alleged that Kleiman was one of the early bitcoin pioneers and worked with Craig Steven Wright on its establishment as a cryptocurrency.

Morgan, dealing predominantly in kdb+/Q. His expertise covers the design, architecture, and implementation of quantitative infrastructure, systems, and tools.In 2014, Delo met Arthur Hayes and Sam Reed, and together the trio co-founded BitMEX, a cryptocurrency derivatives trading platform.PhilanthropyIn October 2018, Delo gave £5 million to his Oxford alma mater Worcester College, endowing two teaching fellowships in perpetuity and becoming the youngest major donor in the College’s 305-year history.In April 2019, Delo signed The Giving Pledge, a program orchestrated by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, announcing his intention to give away at least half of his wealth during his lifetime. In his pledge letter, Delo states that his initial philanthropic interests are focused on long-term and large-scale problems and reducing catastrophic risks and that he is inspired by the philosophy of effective altruism. That month, Delo also became a member of Giving What We Can.  Source: Wikipedia",

    "about": "Joseph Muscat BioDr. Joseph Muscat was born on the 22nd of January 1974. He graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce in Management and Public Policy; a Bachelor of Arts with Honours in Public Policy and a Master of Arts in European Studies from the University of Malta. In 2007, he attained a Doctorate of Philosophy in Management Research from the University of Bristol with a thesis on Fordism, multinationals, and SMEs in Malta. Dr. Muscat successfully contested the first European Parliamentary elections in Malta in 2004. Sitting with the Party of European Socialists, he held the post of Vice-President of the Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and substitute member of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.He was a member of several delegations for relations with Belarus and the countries of south-east Europe. As an MEP, he supported a reduction in the tax for satellite television, the right for customers to watch sports events for free, and several issues related to Malta’s environmental protection. He formed part of a team responsible for a report on the roaming mobile phone bills and sale of banks. In 2006 he was the recipient of the Outstanding Young Person of the Year. Dr. Muscat was elected as the Leader of the Partit Laburista in June 2008.He took office as Prime Minister of Malta on the 11th March 2013. His first premiership was marked for pulling together a national consensus for economic growth, based on a restructured Maltese economy. The directional change resulted in the economic growth of over 6 percent, the elimination of the public deficit and a decrease in unemployment to historic lows. These factors contributed to Malta’s increasingly becoming an attractive location for foreign direct investment in sectors such as financial services, online gaming, information technology, maritime and aviation hubs, and high value-added manufacturing clusters.Among others, the Muscat administration’s family-friendly measures led to a 9 percent increase in female participation in the labor market, poverty was reduced and pensions were increased for the first time in 25 years.His administration was also instrumental for the strengthening of civil liberties, introducing legislation establishing civil unions for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples with the same rights as those available to married couples, including joint adoption rights. Same-sex marriage was legalized in mid-July 2017. Joseph Muscat was sworn in as Prime Minister for a second term on the 5th of June 2017.Prime Minister Muscat is currently the Commonwealth Chair-in-Office. He also led Malta’s Presidency of the European Union in the first half of 2017. Dr. Muscat is married to Michelle, the parents of twins, Etoile Ella and Soleil Sophie.Prime Minister Muscat is responsible for creating a blockchain-friendly regulatory environment on Malta, affectionately nicknaming it “Blockchain Island.”  Source: World Economic Forum",

    "about": "Jeff Garzik BioJeff Garzik, better known as the CEO of blockchain startup Bloq, now believes his prior work could be revived in a way that promotes interoperability between the increasingly fragmented set of protocols bearing the bitcoin name. He was also a contributor to Bitcoin Core.Jeff has a long history of early technology adoption. After helping to inaugurate CNN.com on the Internet in the early 1990s, he worked for a succession of Internet startups and service providers. At the same time, he worked continuously on open source software engineering projects for over two decades.Involvement in one of the best known open source projects – the Linux kernel – led to an extended tenure at Linux leader Red Hat during open source’s most formative years. Jeff’s work is found in every Android phone and data center Linux installation today.In July 2010, Jeff stumbled across a post describing bitcoin. Immediately recognizing the potential of a concept previously thought impossible — decentralized digital money, he did what came naturally: developed bitcoin open source software. That gave rise to the start of micro-businesses with bitcoin at their foundation. Almost by accident, Jeff found himself at the heart of the global, revolutionary, technology phenomenon known as bitcoin.Bitcoin and blockchain served as a springboard for many new ideas and ventures, including sending objects into outer space.

    "about": "Andrew Fai BioThe idea of DeStation Protocol was conceived by Andrew Fai, a serial blockchain entrepreneur. He is widely recognized as a thought leader within the NFT space and respected as the power networker connecting opportunities and talent for Crypto 100 and Fortune 500 companies since 2017.Fai has consulted on numerous DeFi and NFT projects since 2019 and said:“NFT is not merely crypto art, but an access token that enables a unique integration to infinite applications and services for NFT owners. If we were to consider NFTs as connectionless IP addresses, then DeStation is positioned to become the TCP for the NFT space, an augmented data network layer for all existing NFTs across any blockchain. Furthermore, as crypto wallets are installed onto every single mobile device, NFTs will be the catalyst to unlock the unlimited potential of Web3.”Fai previously founded Asia Blockchain Summit, the largest event of its kind in Greater Asia. ABS played host in the past to highlights like the controversial Tangle in Taipei debate between “Dr. Doom” professor Nouriel Roubini and BitMEX’s Arthur Hayes, astronaut Chris Hadfield’s first bitcoin transaction over satellite with Blockstream, and the Binance Super Meetup.",

It’s designed to give Bitcoin trustless support for thousands of very low-cost transactions per second. In addition to overcoming Bitcoin’s scaling limitations, it adds the capability for cross-chain transactions, privacy protection, micropayments, payment receipts, and multi-hop payments.Poon is also on the team that’s building OmiseGo, a proof-of-stake blockchain, and the decentralized Ethereum-based exchange that will use OmiseGo to let crypto investors trade almost any currency, both fiat, and crypto, with each other directly rather than through third-party companies. The OmiseGo blockchain is expected to launch Q4 2017.",

She has extensive experience helping scale business operations at various start-ups.An initial skeptic until she used these web3 protocols herself, she became fascinated with the issues of scalability that prevent mass adoption and creation of a fully on-chain financial ecosystem. She believes that DeFi dApps play a vital role in powering the Web 3 economy by providing liquidity and composability. As the most basic of all financial primitives, borrowing and lending was where she naturally wanted to start building.

He now promotes Bitcoin Cash, a hard fork of the cryptocurrency created with the intent to fix issues such as high fees and long transaction confirmation times.Born and raised in Silicon Valley, he sold explosives on eBay and later pleaded guilty to three related felony charges. He served 10 months in prison, then moved to Japan in 2005. He renounced his United States citizenship in 2014 after obtaining a Saint Kitts and Nevis passport. He identifies as a libertarian, an anarcho-capitalist, peace advocate, and an advocate for individualism and voluntaryism.Ver began investing in bitcoin in early 2011. The first investment he made was for Charlie Shrem’s Bitinstant. Ver’s investment allowed the company to hire a designer and another programmer. He invested over a million dollars into new bitcoin-related startups including Ripple, Blockchain.info, Bitpay and Kraken. In 2011, Ver’s company Memorydealers was the first to accept bitcoin as payment. His early advocacy for bitcoin earned him the moniker of Bitcoin Jesus.In 2012, Ver was organizing bitcoin meetups in Sunnyvale. He is one of five founders of the Bitcoin Foundation. Ver wants bitcoin to rival major fiat currencies.He is one of the main proponents of a larger block size. He supported the development of Bitcoin XT as a hard fork method towards an increase. Ver and his high school friend Jesse Powell attempted to re-establish the Mt Gox exchange during the June 2011 bitcoin price crash.  Source: Wikipedia",

I started an enterpise blockchain company called Skuchain in 2014 and started teaching myself cryptography. I started contributing more to projects like Bitcoin, Zcash, Tendermint, Ethereum etc. I got interested in weird ideas like scalable public blockchains.In 2017, I co-founded the Trusted IoT Alliance and iqlusion. I also started contributing more to Cosmos. I helped build the first validator dashboard and then Figment ran with the idea. I helped launch the first public Cosmos testnets. I spent a lot of 2018 working part time at All In Bits, building out the validator ecosystem, and figuring how do actually do quality assurance to enable the Cosmos launch. In 2019, after the Hub launch, I joined All in Bits as Director of Research. Where I worked on finishing the Cosmos design goals by completing IBC.After All In Bits proved too unstable to finish the work, I resigned in Feb 2019 and am completeing the IBC work with the community from contributors from Agoric, Interchain Berlin and Informal.",

Lubin is founder of ConsenSys, a Brooklyn-based software-production studio.In early 2014, Lubin was Chief Operating Officer of Ethereum Switzerland GmbH (EthSuisse), a company working to extend the capabilities of the type of blockchain database first popularized by Bitcoin, and extend the capabilities of the blockchain to store programs in addition to data, as well as facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of smart contracts. The new generation of distributed crypto-secure databases with smart contract functionality has been referred to as “Blockchain 2.0”Lubin was also involved in the creation of the Ethereum Foundation, a Toronto-based non-profit organization to be a “nonpartisan industry body, made up of [a cross-section of] industry players.

It develops software mainly for the Ethereum blockchain system. It also provides decentralized software services to companies. They also do enterprise and government consulting. In fact, the European Union has picked ConsenSys to be one of the primary companies to help spread blockchain all across Europe.Lubin has been personally involved in cross-industry groups attempting to advance solutions to governance issues in the blockchain industry.

    "about": "Sam Kazemian BioSam Kazemian is an Iranian-American software engineer, entrepreneur, and cryptocurrency enthusiast. He is the Co-Founder and President of Everipedia, the first decentralized online encyclopedia on the blockchain. He founded the company with Theodor Forselius, Mahbod Moghadam, and Travis Moore in 2015.In December 2014, Sam Kazemian co-founded Everipedia. He started the project in his dorm room while attending UCLA. He developed the first MVP for the project with Theodor Forselius with the aim of becoming a more modern and inclusive version of Wikipedia; since then, Everipedia launched a blockchain network in which people can stake IQ tokens to contribute to the platform.As President of Everipedia, Kazemian has led his team to transition Everipedia from an online encyclopedia to a blockchain knowledge platform. He also played a crucial role in airdropping IQ tokens to EOS token holders in 2018. In January 2018, he and Everipedia set a precedent by announcing their airdrop to the EOS genesis distribution list; the announcement was made at an EOS meetup in Seoul.His latest initiative focuses on the development of several new decentralized applications (dApps) that will function on the IQ token. In December 2018, he commented on the expansion of the what is now called the IQ Network.In June 2019, it was reported that Kazemian was starting a new company, Decentral, with former Federal Reserve board nominee Stephen Moore. The company plans to produce a stablecoin cryptocurrency which is kept price-stable through a reserve of cryptocurrency and issuance of digital bonds.  Source: Everipedia",

    "about": "Adam Todd BioAdam Todd is CEO and Founder of Digitex Futures, the world’s first commission-free bitcoin futures trading platform. Determined and ambitious, Adam formed his early career as a futures trader in the open outcry trading pits of the London International Financial Futures & Options Exchange (LIFFE).Mastering the short-term scalping trading style, Adam became an aggressive high-frequency trader, entering and exiting positions quickly and trading off the smallest fluctuations in price. As a scalper, he lent liquidity to the markets because of his active trading, however, he frequently suffered from hefty commission fees.These fees would often turn his winning days into losing ones and were “the bane of his life” as a trader. He dreamed of a trading ecosystem in which the fees were removed entirely. After four years in the fast-paced frenetic trading pits, Adam took a sabbatical to travel the world and worked trading bets on peer-to-peer betting exchange Betfair.Instead of buying and selling futures contracts, Adam bought and sold bets that people laid on horses. Just like German government bonds he once traded, he had no knowledge or interest in the horses; he merely learned to trade on momentum, buying and selling bets for small profits, strengthening his skills as a scalper.While trading on Betfair, Adam created a trading ladder, borrowed from the futures industry, that would allow him and other traders to place bets with a single click, rather than having to use the clunky web interface. Adam’s trading ladder became so popular that he was able to switch from being a full-time trader to running a software app.When he discovered Ethereum and the ability to create his own token, Adam realized that he could create a platform and offer zero-fee trading to the world. He could also allow for rapid-fire trading with a similar ladder to the one he created for Betfair. Traders see the bids and offers moving up and down and can stay in the zone without any extra keyboard or mouse movements.Thus, Digitex Futures was born. With an ICO in 2018 and ongoing development since then, Adam is continuously learning. It isn’t easy being a pioneer in an emerging industry, building a product with no precedent. Yet, he’s continued on the journey, fueled by his dream of zero-fee trading.With the testnet about to launch on November 30, soon the ex-pit trader who never gave up will finally see the fruits of his labor. Adam is getting ready to shake up the crypto futures ecosystem by removing the fees–and he’s loving every single minute.",

Ayre also hosts an ongoing series of CoinGeek Conferences that bring together notable figures in the cryptocurrency sector.Following the 2018 hard fork of the Bitcoin network, Ayre became a champion of BSV.Ayre launched his CoinGeek-branded mining pool, which focuses exclusively on mining BSV. CoinGeek is also a founding member of the Bitcoin Association.Ayre currently resides in Antigua, where he oversees his Calvin Ayre Foundation charitable arm. In 2018, Ayre was named the Antiguan Halo Foundation’s Philanthropist of the Year at its annual Wings of Charity event.In 2017, Ayre was appointed a special economic envoy for the government of Antigua and Barbuda. Ayre advises the government on the effective implementation of new technological developments in cryptocurrency and Bitcoin and to foster economic cooperation on blockchain technology with other countries.

    "about": "Kevin O’Leary BioTerence Thomas Kevin O’Leary, nicknamed “Mr. Wonderful”, is a Canadian businessman, entrepreneur, investor, author, political candidate, and television presenter.Kevin O’Leary’s success story starts where most entrepreneurs begin: with a big idea and zero cash. From his basement, he launched SoftKey Software Products. As sales took off, Kevin moved to headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts and went on an industry consolidating acquisition binge.From 1995 to 1999 he bought out almost every one of his software competitors, including Mindscape, Broderbund and the Learning Company in the industry’s first vicious public hostile battle. Shareholders loved his take-no-prisoners, cost cutting style and fueled him with billions to do his deals.In 1999 Kevin sold his company to the Mattel Toy Company for $4.2 billion, one of the largest deals ever done in the consumer software industry. To keep his money working hard, he took control of his wealth from his lackluster money managers and founded his own mutual fund company, O’Leary Funds. He raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors who share his “get paid while you wait” yield oriented, value investing philosophy. He shares his tips and tribulations with a national television audience and turns The Street upside down in the process.As a self-proclaimed “Eco-preneur,” Kevin looks hardest for investments that make money – and are environmentally friendly. When he’s not squeezing the market from his office, he travels the world looking for new opportunities to deploy his capital. He is on the investment committee of Boston’s prestigious 200-year-old Hamilton Trust.He launched O’Shares ETFs, a group of exchange traded funds. He is O’Shares Chairman.  Source: LinkedIn",

She developed a custom toon shader which gives the illusion of 3D elements being 2D illustrated, inspired by the art of Moebius.Outside of digital mediums, pplpleasr often incorporates hand drawn elements into her work and is familiar with traditional mediums such as painting.Pplpleasr’s work strives to find the perfect balance between the extremes of being familiar enough that it’s not alienating, and novel enough that it’s not boring.",

He is an avid cryptocurrency investor and self-proclaimed Ethereum maximalist. He owns a few cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and has invested in a few blockchain companies.Mark Cuban founded video portal Broadcast.com with fellow Indiana University alum Todd Wagner in 1995 and sold it to Yahoo for $5.7 billion in 1999.Today he owns the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks and has stakes in Magnolia Pictures, AXS TV and dozens of small startups.He sold stamps door-to-door as a kid and gave disco lessons to help pay his way through Indiana University.Cuban was inspired to strike out on his own when he was fired from a software shop for closing a $15,000 sale instead of cleaning up the store.He invests in mission-driven companies such as Luminaid, which provides lighting to disaster areas, and Mahmee, a maternal healthcare tech company.Cuban has invested in the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, as well as accepting the particular cryptocurrency as a method of payment for Dallas Mavericks merchandise and tickets since at least early 2021. After being asked by CNBC for his thoughts on the payment method, Cuban responded, “It’s a medium that can be used for the acquisition of goods and services, the community for doge is the strongest when it comes to using it as a medium of exchange.”  Source: Wikipedia, Forbes",

    "about": "Ross Ulbricht BioRoss William Ulbricht (born March 27, 1984) is a convicted American darknet market operator and narcotics trafficker, best known for creating and running the Silk Road website from 2011 until his arrest in 2013. He was known under the pseudonym “Dread Pirate Roberts,” after the fictional character in the novel The Princess Bride (1973) and its 1987 film adaptation.\n Ulbricht was convicted of money laundering, computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic fraudulent identity documents, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics by means of the Internet in February 2015.  He is currently serving a double life sentence plus forty years without the possibility of parole. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the conviction and sentence in May 2017. The Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear a further appeal in June 2018.  The Maryland prosecution dismissed with prejudice a five-year-old pending indictment in July 2018. Early life and educationUlbricht grew up in the Austin metropolitan area. He was a Boy Scout, attaining the rank of Eagle Scout. He attended West Ridge Middle School, and Westlake High School, both near Austin. He graduated from high school in 2002.He attended the University of Texas at Dallas on a full academic scholarship, and graduated in 2006 with a bachelor’s degree in physics.  He then attended Pennsylvania State University, where he was in a master’s degree program in materials science and engineering and studied crystallography. By the time Ulbricht graduated, he had become interested in libertarian economic theory. In particular, Ulbricht adhered to the political philosophy of Ludwig von Mises, supported Ron Paul, and participated in college debates to discuss his economic views.Ulbricht graduated from Penn State in 2009 and returned to Austin. By this time Ulbricht, finding regular employment unsatisfying, wanted to become an entrepreneur, but his first attempts to start his own business failed. He tried day trading and started a video game company. His mother claimed that his LinkedIn profile referred to a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, not a darknet market, when it stated, “I am creating an economic simulation to give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force.”  He eventually partnered with his friend Donny Palmertree to help build an online used bookseller, Good Wagon Books.

In developing WikiScanner, Griffith described his mission as “to create minor public-relations disasters for companies and organizations I dislike.” Griffith was arrested in 2019 for giving an Ethereum related presentation in North Korea.On November 28, 2019, Griffith was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for providing “highly technical information to North Korea, knowing that this information could be used to help North Korea launder money and evade sanctions.” The charges stem from his unsanctioned participation in an April 2019 blockchain and cryptocurrency conference held in Pyongyang, North Korea. During and after the conference, Griffith was alleged to have discussed means through which North Korea could use cryptocurrency to evade economic sanctions.  Source: Wikipedia",

Ordano held the position as Decentraland’s chief technology officer, though he recently stepped back to a more advisory role after the platform became a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Meilich also holds an adviser position in the project despite his departure. Meilich and Ordano are Argentinian software developers with varying backgrounds in the crypto space.Ordano went to school at the Instituto Tecnologico de Buenos Aires engineering school and worked as an engineering intern at Google for a brief period before starting at BitPay. Ordano also helped build a few Bitcoin-related products.  Meilich studied neuroscience and economics at New York University and used Bitcoin to run his outsourcing business in college, which struggled due to the country’s strict laws. This usage exposed him to the ‘freedom’ offered by blockchain technology, which inspired him to join Voltaire, a ‘hacker house’ in Buenos Aires. Meilich and Ordano met at Voltaire before getting together to start Decentraland.  Source: cointelegraph",

He founded and conducted a successful token sale for the Lendroid Foundation, a credit engine that powers financial services on the blockchain. He also founded Portkey Technologies Pte Ltd, a software technology provider. Among the first to recognise, he funded some truly unique projects in crypto, including Ethereum, Polkadot, Dfinity, Omisego and Decentraland.Having dabbled in stocks and conventional financial instruments as a teenager, Vignesh fell in love with the uncensorable, open world of blockchain in 2013 as a student of Carleton University, Canada. He founded my first crypto startup Coins-e in 2013 and sold it to Casa Crypto in May 2014. In 2014, he built a prototype for Canada’s first BTM (Bitcoin Teller Machine) and set it up first in Ottawa, Canada. This grew into BitAccess, a Y-Combinator funded enterprise. The Lendroid Foundation represents a long-time dream to enable credit as it should be – global and unopinionated. Portkey Technologies is meant to provide a range of software services across conventional and decentralised systems.",

    "about": "Gavin Anderson BioGavin Andresen is a software developer best known for his involvement with Bitcoin. He is based in Amherst, Massachusetts.Originally a developer of 3D graphics and virtual reality software, he became involved in developing products for the Bitcoin market in 2010 and was declared by Satoshi Nakamoto as the lead developer of the reference implementation for bitcoin client software after Satoshi Nakamoto had announced his departure. In 2012 he founded the Bitcoin Foundation to support and nurture the development of the bitcoin currency, and by 2014 left his software development role to concentrate on his work with the Foundation.CareerAndresen graduated from Princeton University in 1988. He began his career working on 3D graphics software at Silicon Graphics Computer Systems. In 1996, he co-authored the VRML 2.0 specification and later published a reference manual for VRML 2.0.Since leaving Silicon Valley in 1996, Andresen has tackled a wide variety of software-related ventures, including CTO of an early voice-over-the-Internet startup and co-founder of a company that made multiplayer online games for blind people and their sighted friends.BitcoinAndresen was the lead developer for a part of the bitcoin digital currency project, working to create a secure, stable “cash for the Internet.” Andresen discovered bitcoin in 2010, quickly recognizing the brilliance of its design. Soon after he created a website named The Bitcoin Faucet which gave away bitcoin.  In April 2011, Forbes quoted Andresen as saying, “Bitcoin is designed to bring us back to a decentralized currency of the people,” and “this is like better gold than gold.” After joining the developers contributing to Bitcoin along with Satoshi Nakamoto, he went on to become lead developer of the client software for the bitcoin network which is now known as Bitcoin Core He stepped back as a lead maintainer in 2014.Andresen also created ClearCoin, an escrow-type of service, which was closed on about June 23, 2011. After several years working on the software, Andresen left the role of lead developer of bitcoin to work on the strategic development of its technology. He conceived of the Bitcoin Foundation which became reality in 2012.In May 2016 Andresen stated that the Australian programmer and entrepreneur Craig Wright was Satoshi Nakamoto, but later expressed regret getting involved in the “’who was Satoshi’ game.”Andresen has not contributed to Bitcoin Core since February 2016. He had become critical of the failure of bitcoin developers to increase network capacity, and helped put together Bitcoin XT as alternative software. His commit access to Bitcoin Core on GitHub was revoked in May 2016 after stating Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto. In November 2017, Andresen expressed support for rival currency Bitcoin Cash, stating “Bitcoin Cash is what I started working on in 2010”.  Source: Wikipedia",

Being the tech geek he is, he moved away from the mobile space in 2016 to explore things that might excite him more which led him to create and dabble into web services, saas, machine learning, ai and finally blockchain.Intent on learning more, he joined a fintech blockchain startup to gain expertise and learn the nooks and corners of blockchain tech before deciding to continue his “decentralized” entrepreneurial journey.This new beginning led him to discover various pain points of blockchain adoption and he quickly realized how blockchain doesn’t have decentralize communication protocol yet, a concept which is tied to our online presence and the traditional web 2.0 services which led to the invention of Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS).",

Erik founded ShapeShift in August 2014 as an elegant, secure, and fast solution to digital asset exchanges.As a non-custodial solution, ShapeShift offers users the ability to convert digital assets without having to trust a centralized entity. Erik was most recently featured on the 2016 documentary, “Banking on Bitcoin.” His past blockchain company affiliations include: BitInstant, Coinapult and, most notably, SatoshiDice, which was responsible for most of the Bitcoin transactions in 2012 and 2013",

Pavel left Russia and VK in early 2014 to focus on developing Telegram.In 2018 Pavel, with his brother Nikolai Durov, raised $1.7 billion from investors to create TON, a blockchain system based on Telegram. On October 11, 2019, the US SEC announced an emergency action against Gram and obtained temporary restraining order against Telegram on alleged unregistered, ongoing digital token offering in the U.S. Telegram lost a legal battle with US Securities and Exchange Commission. The project had moved from TON to Toncoin and the new project is independent from Telegram.Durov was listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2021, with a net worth of $17.2 billion. His fortune is largely driven by his ownership of Telegram.",

    "about": "Ben Zhou BioBen Zhou is the co-founder and CEO of Bybit, a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange headquartered in Singapore. After having spent his teenage years in New Zealand and going to university in the United States, Zhou returned to China and was the general manager for the Greater China region for Forex brokers XM for seven years, before co-founding Bybit in early 2018. He began to take an interest in crypto in 2016 after being introduced by a friend and was quickly drawn in by the possibilities and potential that he saw in crypto trading. In 2017, as crypto prices soared and more and more people began to take an interest in crypto, he realized that general public awareness was somewhat lacking.Therefore, he decided to form a YouTube channel, to educate viewers about the burgeoning industry. He ran this channel until shortly before Bybit was established. It was through this newfound interest in crypto, along with the experience he gained from his time at XM, that he not only gained enthusiasm for the field, but he also saw first hand some of the inefficiencies that crypto trading had at the time, such as overloads, and the lack of decent customer support. It was these factors that led to him co-founding Bybit.With the motto “we listen, we care, we improve”, Bybit was founded with the goal of raising the bar for crypto derivative exchanges and providing the best possible trading experience. Offering perpetual contracts, the platform is equipped with the capacity of handling 100,000 TPS, which equates to one match taking 10 microseconds. With platform updates applied through hot patch and grey release, Bybit also has no server downtime. In addition, Bybit offers 24/7 live chat customer support, available in English, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.",

He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering in 2002 under the supervision of Brian N. Bershad.Before becoming a professor at Cornell University Sirer worked at AT&T Bell Labs on Plan 9, at DEC SRC, and at NEC.Sirer is best known for his contributions to operating systems, distributed systems, and fundamental cryptocurrency research. He co-developed the SPIN (operating system), where the implementation and interface of an operating system could be modified safely at run-time by type-safe extension code. He also led the Nexus OS effort, where he developed new techniques for attesting to, and reasoning about, the semantic properties of remote programs. His Karma system, published in 2003, is the first cryptocurrency that uses a distributed mint based on proof-of-work.In conjunction with his research group, he published the paper “Majority is not Enough, Bitcoin Mining is Vulnerable” which described the selfish mining attack, an attack on Bitcoin with only 1/3 of total hash power. He also developed Bitcoin-NG, a bitcoin scaling solution, and Bitcoin Covenants, a security solution. He is also co-founder of bloXroute, a company focusing on solving the forgotten “layer 0” networking layer. He is also the founder of Ava Labs, a project building the cryptocurrency AVA, and computing platform using Avalanche Consensus.  Source: Wikipedia",

He is the chairman, chief executive officer, and co-founder of social networking website Facebook. His net worth is estimated to be US$54.5 billion as of September 2016, ranking him as the 5th richest person in the world.Together with his college roommates and fellow Harvard University students Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, he launched Facebook from Harvard’s dormitory rooms. The group then introduced Facebook to other campuses. Facebook expanded rapidly, with one billion users by 2012. Zuckerberg was involved in various legal disputes that were initiated by others in the group, who claimed a share of the company based upon their involvement during the development phase of Facebook.In December 2012, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan announced they would give the majority of their wealth over the course of their lives to “advancing human potential and promoting equality” in the spirit of The Giving Pledge. On December 1, 2015, they announced they would give 99% of their Facebook shares (worth about $45 billion at the time) to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.  Source: Everipedia",

He is also a notable figure in the world of cryptography and distributed computing. The first mention of a blockchain architecture was from a publication he co-authored which described a digital hierarchy system known as a “block chain” that utilized digital time-stamps for ordering transactions.The concept of a blockchain system was later adopted by Satoshi Nakamoto in developing the popular blockchain for Bitcoin. Together with his long-time colleague and collaborator, Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta laid the foundation for the emergence of today’s blockchain technology revolution.Stornetta is touted as the co-inventor of the blockchain, together with Stuart Haber. Stornetta has spent decades contributing valuable research and published materials to the field of cryptography and distributed computing and has consulted for several universities on the establishment of startup companies.
