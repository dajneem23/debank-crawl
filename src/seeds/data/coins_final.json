The goal is to achieve price stability while maintaining a floating market-driven price.The biggest difference between OHM and stablecoins like USDC is that OHM is backed but not pegged to a certain price. Technically, the price floor for OHM is 1 DAI, but practically a premium and the treasury value is added to the price. OHM differs from other algorithmic stablecoins like Ampleforth (AMPL) because it issues OHM to buy DAI and other assets and maintain a treasury. This mechanism is similar to FEI; the key difference is that FEI keeps a dollar peg, and Olympus allows its token to float.",
