He graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce in Management and Public Policy; a Bachelor of Arts with Honours in Public Policy and a Master of Arts in European Studies from the University of Malta. In 2007, he attained a Doctorate of Philosophy in Management Research from the University of Bristol with a thesis on Fordism, multinationals, and SMEs in Malta. Dr. Muscat successfully contested the first European Parliamentary elections in Malta in 2004. Sitting with the Party of European Socialists, he held the post of Vice-President of the Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and substitute member of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.He was a member of several delegations for relations with Belarus and the countries of south-east Europe. As an MEP, he supported a reduction in the tax for satellite television, the right for customers to watch sports events for free, and several issues related to Malta’s environmental protection. He formed part of a team responsible for a report on the roaming mobile phone bills and sale of banks. In 2006 he was the recipient of the Outstanding Young Person of the Year. Dr. Muscat was elected as the Leader of the Partit Laburista in June 2008.He took office as Prime Minister of Malta on the 11th March 2013. His first premiership was marked for pulling together a national consensus for economic growth, based on a restructured Maltese economy. The directional change resulted in the economic growth of over 6 percent, the elimination of the public deficit and a decrease in unemployment to historic lows. These factors contributed to Malta’s increasingly becoming an attractive location for foreign direct investment in sectors such as financial services, online gaming, information technology, maritime and aviation hubs, and high value-added manufacturing clusters.Among others, the Muscat administration’s family-friendly measures led to a 9 percent increase in female participation in the labor market, poverty was reduced and pensions were increased for the first time in 25 years.His administration was also instrumental for the strengthening of civil liberties, introducing legislation establishing civil unions for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples with the same rights as those available to married couples, including joint adoption rights. Same-sex marriage was legalized in mid-July 2017. Joseph Muscat was sworn in as Prime Minister for a second term on the 5th of June 2017.Prime Minister Muscat is currently the Commonwealth Chair-in-Office. He also led Malta’s Presidency of the European Union in the first half of 2017. Dr. Muscat is married to Michelle, the parents of twins, Etoile Ella and Soleil Sophie.Prime Minister Muscat is responsible for creating a blockchain-friendly regulatory environment on Malta, affectionately nicknaming it “Blockchain Island.”  Source: World Economic Forum",

He also had the ability to add three-digit numbers in his head at twice the speed of his peers.In 2012, he obtained a Bronze Medal in the International Olympiad in Informatics. He attended the University of Waterloo but dropped out in 2014, when he received the Thiel Fellowship, and went to work on Bitcoin full-time.Buterin is a co-creator and inventor of Ethereum, described as a “decentralized mining network and software development platform rolled into one” that facilitates the creation of new cryptocurrencies and programs that share a single blockchain (a cryptographic transaction ledger).

    "about": "Kevin O’Leary BioTerence Thomas Kevin O’Leary, nicknamed “Mr. Wonderful”, is a Canadian businessman, entrepreneur, investor, author, political candidate, and television presenter.Kevin O’Leary’s success story starts where most entrepreneurs begin: with a big idea and zero cash. From his basement, he launched SoftKey Software Products. As sales took off, Kevin moved to headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts and went on an industry consolidating acquisition binge.From 1995 to 1999 he bought out almost every one of his software competitors, including Mindscape, Broderbund and the Learning Company in the industry’s first vicious public hostile battle. Shareholders loved his take-no-prisoners, cost cutting style and fueled him with billions to do his deals.In 1999 Kevin sold his company to the Mattel Toy Company for $4.2 billion, one of the largest deals ever done in the consumer software industry. To keep his money working hard, he took control of his wealth from his lackluster money managers and founded his own mutual fund company, O’Leary Funds. He raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors who share his “get paid while you wait” yield oriented, value investing philosophy. He shares his tips and tribulations with a national television audience and turns The Street upside down in the process.As a self-proclaimed “Eco-preneur,” Kevin looks hardest for investments that make money – and are environmentally friendly. When he’s not squeezing the market from his office, he travels the world looking for new opportunities to deploy his capital. He is on the investment committee of Boston’s prestigious 200-year-old Hamilton Trust.He launched O’Shares ETFs, a group of exchange traded funds. He is O’Shares Chairman.  Source: LinkedIn",

He has over 11 years entrepreneurial experience in various spectrum of tech; including architecting, development and design in different tech fields (Mobile, Web Services, SaaS, Blockchain).He started his entrepreneur journey with mobile apps and games back in 2009 and have seen various facets of the industry since then. Being the tech geek he is, he moved away from the mobile space in 2016 to explore things that might excite him more which led him to create and dabble into web services, saas, machine learning, ai and finally blockchain.Intent on learning more, he joined a fintech blockchain startup to gain expertise and learn the nooks and corners of blockchain tech before deciding to continue his “decentralized” entrepreneurial journey.This new beginning led him to discover various pain points of blockchain adoption and he quickly realized how blockchain doesn’t have decentralize communication protocol yet, a concept which is tied to our online presence and the traditional web 2.0 services which led to the invention of Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS).",

In 2012 he sold his rental properties in order to invest in Bitcoin, and began to organize companies in the field of cryptocurrency.CareerDi Iorio began his career working in marketing at a machine manufacturer before he went on to manage his family’s patio-door making business in Woodbridge, Ontario. The family business was sold in 2008, and Di Iorio’s father supported him as he launched a short-lived geothermal drilling company.He first learned about bitcoin from a podcast called Free Talk Live in 2012. According to The Globe and Mail, he “had an anti-authoritarian streak” and questioned “the fundamentals of mainstream economics.” Di Iorio bought his first bitcoin the same day for $9.73. He created the Toronto Bitcoin Meetup Group which held its first meeting at a pub in the same year. It was at this first meeting where he met Vitalik Buterin who went own to be the founder of Bitcoin Magazine and one of the original creators of Ethereum. As the Meetups grew from about eight attendees to hundreds, Di Iorio formed the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada.In 2013 Di Iorio founded a Bitcoin wallet Chrome extension called KryptoKit, with Steve Dakh, that created an app for web browsers that allows users to pay for products and services using the cryptocurrency wallet. In 2014 Di Iorio co-founded the cryptocurrency platform Ethereum, which has been valued at $7 billion and had a market cap of $1.6 billion in 2017. He has since also invested in several other currencies including Zcash. Etherium was later joined by Buterin, Erik Voorhees, and Roger Ver in 2014.TSX, Jaxx, and boardsIn January 2016, TMX Group hired Di Iorio as the first chief digital officer of the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX).

In addition to overcoming Bitcoin’s scaling limitations, it adds the capability for cross-chain transactions, privacy protection, micropayments, payment receipts, and multi-hop payments.Poon is also on the team that’s building OmiseGo, a proof-of-stake blockchain, and the decentralized Ethereum-based exchange that will use OmiseGo to let crypto investors trade almost any currency, both fiat, and crypto, with each other directly rather than through third-party companies.

Ever since, Jacob has gone on to trade in other markets such as forex, options, commodities and now cryptocurrencies.In addition, Canfield is a serial entrepreneur that has co-founded over 7 companies in the past 8 years – without traditional funding – that have all gone on to become profitable within their first year. His businesses are in a wide variety of sectors that include mobile application development, healthcare, e-commerce, and private investment education.Canfield uses a combination of trend forecasting, advanced technical analysis, and early adopter technology cycles to stay at the forefront of where smart money, retail traders, investors and crowds are moving. Since 2016, he has turned his attention to the blockchain and crypto asset industry and is involved in multiple facets, from trading, investing and advising.In late 2017, Canfield co-founded the crypto trading platform and one of the largest trading communities, Signal Profits. Shortly after, in May 2018, Jacob was nominated for “Best Coin Predictions” and “Best Live Stream” during the largest crypto conference in the world, Consensys in New York City. That same week, he won the “Best Live Stream” award at the 2018 Crypto Influence Summit.  Source: signalprofits.com",

We engage, interact, and subconsciously consume marketing every day. Understanding the reasoning and strategies behind how products are marketed based on primary and secondary market research is an avenue I have explored in my degree and aspire to investigate further.I am now pursuing a career in consumer marketing in web3 because the idea of better understanding ordinary people’s lives in a digital or Analog environment is becoming extremely topical. It is now challenging to avoid media, pop culture, art and therefore marketing. However, marking sure the marketing is effective, reaching your target audiences, and receiving the proper engagement is critical. Any web3 marketing strategy aims to turn a consumer into a customer, creating a community around your project. Allowing for research and a better understanding your audiences.",
