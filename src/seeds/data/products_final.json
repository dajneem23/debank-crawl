Land is divided into parcels that are identified by cartesian coordinates (x,y). These parcels are permanently owned by members of the community and are purchased using MANA, Decentraland’s cryptocurrency token. This gives users full control over the environments and applications that they create, which can range from anything like static 3D scenes to more interactive applications or games.",
      "Some parcels are further organized into themed communities, or Districts. By organizing parcels into Districts, the community can create shared spaces with common interests and uses. You can find a list of the original District Proposals on GitHub. The content that makes up Decentraland is stored and distributed via the IPFS network while ownership and transactions are validated on the Ethereum blockchain.",
      "While Decentraland is still under active development and there is currently no way to access the world, it will support several platforms: you will be able to access Decentraland from a mobile device, a web browser, or a VR headset to enhance your immersive experience."
